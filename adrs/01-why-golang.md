# Context
This is a playground project that I use to test some techniques in Golang.

You may think this project is over-engineering, but usually we run bigger services that need different techniques, so here I test them using this twitter-like project.

# Decision
Let's use Golang, as I want to test Golang techniques :P (sorry, it sounds pretty obviusoly)

# Consequences
I'll not learn neither rust or elixir right now, but that's ok, more toy project are coming

# Status
Approved
